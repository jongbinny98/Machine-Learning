CSE144(Applied machine learning)
University of California, Santa Cruz


course work: applied the basic machine learning with using python and google colab.

hw1: Song_prediction
--> used dataset "Song_prediction" to learn how to pre processing the dataset and get
    used to python and google colab.

hw2: Logistic_regression
--> build the logistic_regression that we learned in class.

hw3: Support vector machine 
--> build the support machine vector with soft margin and also in dual form.
